🌌 About Us — Team AETHER VITAE

We are AETHER VITAE, a multidisciplinary team representing the University of Guadalajara, participating in the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025.
Our mission is to explore the origin and possibility of life beyond Earth by developing a Knowledge Engine for Space Biology — an AI-powered system that integrates and analyzes scientific data to identify potential biosignatures on the Moon and Mars.

Inspired by the ancient concept of Æther —the primordial essence of the cosmos— we combine science, creativity, and technology to push the boundaries of human understanding about life in the universe.

To merge astrobiology, artificial intelligence, and data science in the search for life beyond Earth —
transforming data into cosmic insight and curiosity into discovery.

Would you like me to add a short “Project Overview” section next (to describe the repo’s purpose, tech stack, and objectives)? It’s great for visitors and helps structure your GitHub documentation professionally.

Added EdgeDriver to open each PMC link directly in headless mode.

With the "plugins.always_open_pdf_externally" option set to True, Edge automatically downloads the PDF to the folder you define in "download.default_directory".

We don't use requests.get() â†’ this avoids header and cookie issues.

The log saves the progress of each download.

Selenium was installed. It controls a real browser (Edge in this case). It follows all redirects, cookies, and scripts, just like when you do it manually.

This script solves the above problems.

Uses BeautifulSoup to search for PDFs within the page.

- If not found, skips with a message.

- Saves PDFs with a numeric name + title.

- Names PDFs as [number]_[title].pdf

- Searches for real PDFs in HTML pages (scraping with BeautifulSoup). If a PDF link is found, download it.

- Handles relative links

- Avoids saving HTML pages as PDFs

- Supports direct links and PMCs

- Automatically detects PMC links and builds the direct URL to the PDF.

- Avoids unnecessary scraping for PMCs, making the process faster.

This script had the following download problems for one of the following reasons:

Server restrictions: Some servers may block or limit automated downloads.

Required HTTP Headers: This means the server may require specific headers (such as User-Agent, Referer, etc.) to allow the download.

This didn't work because PubMed Central doesn't allow direct download of the PDF with a simple request to .../pdf/ because that URL returns a redirect or an intermediate page, not the actual PDF file.

Redirects: The URL may redirect to another page or file, preventing direct download.
